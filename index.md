1. CrowdRescue App (LAUNCHED)

SUMMARY: The US civilian crowd source disaster response community I have been active in for the past 4 years in 14 hurricanes and dozens of floods, fires and earthquakes operates as a backup to 911 when 911 goes down, which is often especially in hurricanes. We have literally saved 1000s of lives.
But all the platforms we use like Zello, FB, Twitter. Youtube etc are centralized client server platforms that we want to migrate away from. We need a decentralized platform.
Here is what I want to be able to do with this app:

1. Distribute a free crowdsource civilian disaster response app that links up disaster victims, dispatchers and search and rescue/relief teams.
2. It will be community managed with eBay/CouchSurfing style upvotes and downvotes with comments for each transaction (ie. A transaction can be a victim contacting a dispatcher, a dispatcher deploying a SAR team, a SAR team rescuing a family etc).
3. It will give everyone the option to reveal their GPS location.
4. It will allow text messaging.
5. It will allow voice messaging.
6. It will allow group text chat.
7. It will allow group voice chat.
8. It will reveal disaster responders and victims on a map (who choose to reveal their location) or in relation to an event (ie. Maybe I am in Texas but I am responding as a dispatcher to a disaster in NY so I am visible as a resource for the NY disaster).
9. Decentralized, open source, blockchain, p2p, encrypted, etc

I need help getting this off the ground.
